##  OpenSCAD
The cad files are made in openSCAD. https://openscad.org/ This is amazing free open source software where you create 3D cad models using a programming language rather than a user interface.
What makes this appoach amazing is that changes are easily managed as everything is pure code. 

The OpenSCAD UI has a customizer UI built in which can be used to make certain adjustments to the cad models without the need to code.

Nobody should commit his designs to closed source rent software such as fusion360 if at all avoidable.
